Oscar Munoz
Linklist Card Game
5/14/2025

I added the functionality of the war game. This included the logic for determining whether the computer or the player had the bigger card.
The changes included record keeping, for loops, as well as a results output.
The game uses the linked list in the following ways:
  Cards are stored in a linked list (CardList)
  When a card is drawn, it's removed from the front of the linked list using the getFirst() method.
  The original functionality of displaying the initial deck and player's hand is preserved.

You can play the game by running the program and pressing enter. You can also press 'q' to end the game. The code will keep track of the score and then output the winner at the end.
